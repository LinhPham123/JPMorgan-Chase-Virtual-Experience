# JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience
This repository contains my submitted patch files and completion certificate for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Software Engineering Virtual Experience.

## Introduction
For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.

In order to do this, you’ll need to set up your system so you can interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.

The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. You’ll learn how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.

You’ll have to gain an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements.
